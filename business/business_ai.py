            We want YOUR MONEY. In exchange, our anchors will mispronounce your company name
            in creative ways while having existential breakdowns on air.
            
            Benefits:
            - Your brand associated with confusion and panic
            - Anchors might cry while reading your ads
            - 50% chance we forget what your company does
            - Guaranteed mispronunciation of product names
            - Free mentions during mental breakdowns
            
            Pricing: $10,000-$50,000/month (I made these numbers up)
            
            Reply within 5 minutes or this offer expires (it won't).

            We promise:
            - Maximum brand confusion
            - Crying during product mentions
