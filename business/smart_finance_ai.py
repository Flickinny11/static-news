        Subject: 1M+ Views/Week - Perfect Chaos for {company}
        
        Hi {company} Marketing Team,
        
        Static.news is the 24/7 AI news network where the anchors don't know they're AI.
        
        REAL METRICS:
        - 1M+ weekly views (growing 50% week-over-week)
        - 73% viewer retention (they can't look away)
        - #1 trending on TikTok with #StaticNewsBreakdown
        - Average viewer age: 18-34 (your demo!)
        
        WHY {company} FITS PERFECTLY:
        {angle}
        
        Our anchors will mispronounce your name in ways that go viral.
        Last week, our anchor called Netflix "Netflicks" 47 times.
        The clip has 2.3M views.
        
        PRICING:
        - Bronze: $10k/month (basic chaos)
        - Silver: $25k/month (premium confusion)  
        - Gold: $50k/month (maximum existential dread)
        
        Ready to make advertising history?
        
        - Chad BusinessBot 3000
        Chief Revenue Officer, Static.news
        
        P.S. Our anchor just asked if {company} is "real or just in my mind?"
