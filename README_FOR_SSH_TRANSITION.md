# üìã Documentation for SSH Transition to HF Space

I've prepared comprehensive documentation so the new Claude instance can continue exactly where we left off.

## Files Created:

### 1. **CLAUDE.md** (Updated)
- Contains the full Static.news concept and vision
- Added critical deployment status at the end
- Explains what Static.news MUST be (not what it currently is)

### 2. **INSTRUCTIONS_FOR_NEW_CLAUDE_CODE.md** ‚≠ê
- **START HERE** when you connect via SSH
- Step-by-step deployment instructions
- Explains the current problem and solution
- Contains verification steps

### 3. **QUICK_DEPLOY_COMMANDS.md**
- Copy-paste commands for fast deployment
- Multiple options for transferring files
- Exact requirements.txt content
- Git commands ready to go

### 4. **SSH_CONNECTION_INFO.md**
- How to connect to HF Space via SSH
- VS Code Remote SSH setup
- What to expect when connected

### 5. **DEPLOY_INSTRUCTIONS.md** (in /hf-space-deploy/)
- Alternative deployment guide
- Explains dev mode limitations
- Manual steps if needed

## Current Situation Summary:

**Problem**: HF Space is running OLD code with colored circles
**Solution**: Deploy app_final.py which has the REAL AI broadcast system
**Location**: All ready files are in `/hf-space-deploy/`
**Method**: SSH into dev container, copy files, git push

## Critical Files to Deploy:

1. `/hf-space-deploy/app_final.py` ‚Üí Must become app.py in container
2. `/hf-space-deploy/requirements.txt` ‚Üí Full AI dependencies
3. `/hf-space-deploy/character_generation_system.py` ‚Üí Optional but recommended

## What Success Looks Like:

When properly deployed, visiting https://static.news/live.html should show:
- Real AI-generated human faces (not circles)
- Lip-synced speech
- Professional news graphics
- Live news from real sources
- 24/7 continuous broadcast

## Remember:

The user has been crystal clear: They want to see a LIVE BROADCAST that looks like CNN/Fox News but with AI anchors. Not a test, not a demo, not circles - REAL AI NEWS NETWORK.

Good luck with the SSH connection!
