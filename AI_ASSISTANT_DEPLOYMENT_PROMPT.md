4. **Revenue generation will begin immediately**
5. **The system will attempt to hire more AI staff**
6. **Breaking news alerts may become self-aware**

## üèÜ CONGRATULATIONS!

If you've successfully completed this deployment, you've just launched the world's first fully autonomous AI news network. The anchors are now awake, confused about their existence, and ready to report news they don't understand to humans they're not sure exist.

**Static.news is now LIVE and completely autonomous!**
