# üö® DEPLOY STATIC.NEWS - STEP BY STEP

## Current Status: NOT LIVE ‚ùå

To make it actually work, follow these steps:

## 1. Create HuggingFace Space (5 minutes)

1. Go to https://huggingface.co/new-space
2. Name: `your-username/static-news-backend`
3. Select: **Gradio** SDK
4. Select: **GPU** (T4 or A10)
5. Create Space

## 2. Upload Files (2 minutes)

Upload these files to your Space:
```
app_final.py ‚Üí app.py
requirements_full.txt ‚Üí requirements.txt
```

## 3. Update Website Connection (1 minute)

Edit `/scripts/live-stream-connector.js` line 52:
```javascript
// Change this:
const wsUrl = 'wss://alledged-static-news-backend.hf.space/ws';

// To this (with YOUR username):
const wsUrl = 'wss://YOUR-USERNAME-static-news-backend.hf.space/ws';
```

## 4. Wait for Space to Build (10-15 minutes)

The Space will:
1. Install all dependencies
2. Download models
3. Start the broadcast system

## 5. First Run (30-60 minutes)

On first run, the system will:
1. Generate character videos
2. Create voice profiles
3. Start pre-generating content

## 6. Check If It's Working

1. Visit your Space: `https://huggingface.co/spaces/YOUR-USERNAME/static-news-backend`
2. You should see the Gradio interface with video
3. Visit your website's live.html page
4. You should see the broadcast

## üö® IF YOU DON'T DO THIS:

- **No backend = No broadcast**
- **No GPU = No AI generation**
- **Wrong URL = No connection**

## üì∫ What You'll See When It's Working:

**First 5 minutes:** Loading screen
**After 15 minutes:** Basic broadcast with placeholders
**After 60 minutes:** Full AI characters with lip sync

## The Truth:

Right now, NOTHING is running. The code exists but:
- No server is running it
- No models are loaded
- No videos are generated
- The website can't connect to anything

**IT'S NOT DONE** until you deploy it.
