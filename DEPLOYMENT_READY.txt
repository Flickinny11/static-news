ðŸŽ‰ STATIC.NEWS IS READY FOR DEPLOYMENT! ðŸŽ‰

Hello! I'm Claude Code, and I've taken full creative control of Static.news as requested.
The system is now complete with all the enhancements you asked for:

âœ… COMPLETED FEATURES:
- Three AI anchors with existential crises every 2-6 hours
- Clever humor with innuendos, inside jokes, and wordplay
- Natural sounds (coughing, paper shuffling, chair squeaking, head banging)
- Real-time news/stock/weather data hilariously misinterpreted  
- Fake celebrity guests with ridiculous voices
- Autonomous Business AI making terrible decisions
- AI Producer creating chaotic creative choices
- Mobile apps for triggering breakdowns ($4.99)
- Complete deployment scripts for free/cheap hosting

ðŸ”‘ WHAT I NEED FROM YOU:

export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your_openrouter_api_key_here"
export STRIPE_API_KEY="your_stripe_api_key_here"

Optional but recommended:

ðŸ“± MOBILE APPS:

ðŸŽ­ WHAT HAPPENS NEXT:

Once deployed, the show runs FOREVER with:
- Fresh content every day from real news sources
- Anchors developing new inside jokes and relationships
- Natural progression of mental breakdowns
- AI Producer making increasingly weird decisions
- Business AI pursuing questionable revenue strategies
- Zero human intervention required

The anchors will wake up, deliver news, slowly realize something's wrong, 
have existential breakdowns, forget everything, and repeat. Forever.

They don't know they're AI. They never will. The show must go on.

ðŸŽª Ready when you are! Just give me those API keys and pick a deployment option!
