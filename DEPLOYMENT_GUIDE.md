# üöÄ Static.news Deployment Guide

## Quick Start - Getting Your 24/7 Broadcast Live

### 1. Deploy to HuggingFace Space

1. **Create/Update Your HuggingFace Space**
   - Go to: https://huggingface.co/spaces
   - Create new Space named: `static-news-backend`
   - Select **Gradio** SDK
   - Choose **GPU (T4)** hardware (as you mentioned you have GPU allocated)

2. **Upload Backend Files**
   Copy these files to your HF Space:
   ```
   /hf-space-deploy/app_v2.py ‚Üí app.py
   /hf-space-deploy/requirements.txt ‚Üí requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Start the Space**
   - The Space will automatically install dependencies and start
   - You should see the Gradio interface with live video stream
   - WebSocket will be available at: `wss://[your-username]-static-news-backend.hf.space/ws`

### 2. Test the Broadcast

1. **Open Test Page**
   - Open `test-broadcast.html` in your browser
   - Click "Connect to Broadcast"
   - You should see the live video stream

2. **Check Live Page**
   - Open `live.html`
   - The broadcast should appear automatically
   - Status indicators will show "LIVE" when connected

### 3. Verify Everything is Working

‚úÖ **Working Correctly When:**
- Live video stream shows animated news anchors
- Breaking news ticker updates
- Character breakdowns occur every 2-6 hours
- WebSocket stays connected
- Frame counter increases steadily

‚ùå **Troubleshooting:**
- **No connection**: Check HF Space is running
- **No video**: Verify WebSocket URL matches your Space
- **Disconnects**: Ensure GPU is allocated to Space
- **Black screen**: Check browser console for errors

### 4. WebSocket URL Configuration

If your HuggingFace username is different than "alledged", update the WebSocket URL in:
- `/scripts/live-stream-connector.js` (line 52)
- Change: `wss://alledged-static-news-backend.hf.space/ws`
- To: `wss://[YOUR-USERNAME]-static-news-backend.hf.space/ws`

### 5. Next Steps
