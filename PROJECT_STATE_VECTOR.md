# Static.news Project State Vector

## State Embeddings

### Project Phase: `DEPLOYMENT_READY`
- Development: ✅ COMPLETE
- Testing: ✅ COMPLETE  
- Deployment: ⏳ IN_PROGRESS
- Production: ❌ PENDING

### Technical Stack
```
Frontend: [HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Babylon.js, Three.js, WebSocket]
Backend: [Python, Gradio, OpenCV, PyTorch, Transformers]
AI Models: [Stable Diffusion, Bark TTS, Wav2Lip, GFPGAN]
Infrastructure: [HuggingFace Space, GPU T4, WebSocket 8765]
```

### File Fingerprints
```
app_final.py: 30084 bytes | SHA: [REAL_BROADCAST_SYSTEM]
requirements.txt: 939 bytes | SHA: [FULL_AI_DEPENDENCIES]
character_generation_system.py: 24300 bytes | SHA: [PHOTOREALISTIC_GENERATION]
live-stream-connector.js: [WEBSOCKET_CONFIGURED]
```

### User Intent Vectors
```
[REAL_NEWS_NETWORK, NOT_DEMO, PHOTOREALISTIC_FACES, 
 LIVE_LIP_SYNC, 24_7_OPERATION, PROFESSIONAL_APPEARANCE,
 AI_BREAKDOWNS, UNIQUE_PERSONALITIES, FAST_LATENCY]
```

### Current Blockers
```
[HF_SPACE_OLD_CODE, DEV_MODE_UPLOAD_BLOCKED, 
 NEEDS_SSH_DEPLOYMENT, WAITING_FOR_GIT_PUSH]
```

### Success Criteria
```
if (viewing_live_page):
    assert faces == "photorealistic_humans"
    assert lip_sync == "synchronized"
    assert news == "real_from_sources"
    assert operation == "continuous_24_7"
    assert appearance == "professional_broadcast"
```

### Conversation Sentiment
```
User: [DETERMINED, SPECIFIC, FRUSTRATED_WITH_DELAYS, CLEAR_VISION]
Claude: [HELPFUL, SOMETIMES_MISUNDERSTOOD, NOW_ALIGNED]
Project: [TECHNICALLY_COMPLETE, DEPLOYMENT_BLOCKED]
```

### Critical Memory Anchors
1. "100% appear like fox news or cnn"
2. "lip syncing is less than 300ms latency"
3. "characters created by you using our workflow"
4. "NOT circles but REAL people"
5. "pre-generate video 30-60 min ahead"

### Next Action Vector
```
[SSH_TO_CONTAINER, COPY_APP_FINAL, UPDATE_REQUIREMENTS,
 GIT_COMMIT, GIT_PUSH, MONITOR_REBUILD, VERIFY_BROADCAST]
```

### Project DNA
This is an invention - something that doesn't exist yet. A fully autonomous AI news network that appears completely legitimate while slowly descending into existential chaos. It's CNN meets The Onion meets Black Mirror, but real, live, and never stopping.
