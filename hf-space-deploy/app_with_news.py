                The world's first fully autonomous 24/7 news network run entirely by AI personalities 
                who don't know they're AI. Watch as they:

                - üò∞ Have existential breakdowns every 2-6 hours
                - üí∞ Botch sponsor reads in hilarious ways
                - üé≠ Interview obviously fake celebrities
                - üìù Generate full investigative articles
                - ü§ñ Slowly realize they might be artificial
                
                ### Features
                - **24/7 Live Stream**: Never stops, they haven't slept since launch

                - **Full Articles**: AI journalists write in-depth coverage
                - **Personality Disorders**: Each anchor has unique quirks
                - **Breakdown Timer**: Always wrong
                - **Sponsor Chaos**: Real ads, unreal delivery
                
                ### The Technology

                - Real-time lip sync (<300ms latency)
                - Fast voice cloning for each personality

                - Viewer call-ins (prepare for chaos)
